# Pokémon Blue Remix

This is a Pokemon Blue romhack forked from [pret's disassembly of Pokémon Red and Blue](https://github.com/pret/pokered) and inspired by [TheSmithPlays' Yellow Legacy project](https://github.com/cRz-Shadows/Pokemon_Yellow_Legacy).

The goal is not to reproduce or backport that project, but simply to breathe new life into gen 1 for anyone who prefers Red/Blue over Yellow.

To that end, it will include some updates from Yellow, Yellow Legacy, and the [pret tutorials](https://github.com/pret/pokered/wiki/Tutorials), but largely will try to keep its scope as narrow as possible.

## Changes (✓ = done, no ✓ = in progress)
- All 151 Pokemon are available on a single save, as is the custom.
- Updated interactions for the original 15 types (i.e., no *Steel, Dark,* or *Fairy* backports)
- Updated typing and learnsets to make certain Pokemon more lore-friendly and/or unique
- Updated typing, power, accuracy, and effects to make certain moves more viable or less frustrating (e.g., *Tackle* has 100% accuracy)
- Conversion of all trapping moves (e.g., *Wrap, Fire Spin*) to damaging moves with a secondary status effect
- Struggle, Self-Destruct, and Explosion are all "None"-type (read: *Bird*-type) ✓
- Certain special moves are treated as physical (e.g., *Crabhammer, Thunderpunch*)
- The Ghost type is special instead of physical
- Greater availability of TMsx
- HMs are no longer permanent
- Auto-sort items using the Start button
- Fast text speed and Set battles by default ✓
- The "Down + B" trick actually works

## Why *Blue* Remix?
While *Red Remix* does roll off the tongue, Pokemon Blue was the first Pokemon game I played and the first video game I bought for myself, so I chose that name for nostalgia's sake.
