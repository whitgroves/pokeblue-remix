# Pokémon Blue Remix

This is a Pokemon Blue romhack forked from [pret's disassembly of Pokémon Red and Blue](https://github.com/pret/pokered) and inspired by [TheSmithPlays' Yellow Legacy project](https://github.com/cRz-Shadows/Pokemon_Yellow_Legacy).

The goal is not to reproduce or backport that project, but to breathe new life into gen 1 by rebalancing the type matchups with 25+ years of hindsight.

To that end, it will include some updates from Yellow, Yellow Legacy, and the [pret tutorials](https://github.com/pret/pokered/wiki/Tutorials), but largely will try to keep its scope as narrow as possible.

## Changes (✓ = done, no ✓ = in progress)
- Updated interactions for the original 15 types ([spreadsheet](TypeChart.xlsx))
- Updated typing and learnsets to make certain Pokemon more lore-accurate or unique
- Updated typing, power, accuracy, and effects to make certain moves more viable or less frustrating (e.g., *Tackle* has 100% accuracy)
- Conversion of all trapping moves (e.g., *Wrap, Fire Spin*) to damaging moves with a secondary status effect
- Struggle, Self-Destruct, and Explosion are all "None"-type (read: *Bird*-type) ✓
- Certain special moves are treated as physical (e.g., *Crabhammer, Thunderpunch*)
- The Ghost type is special instead of physical ✓
- All 151 Pokemon available on a single save
- Greater availability of TMs
- HMs are no longer permanent
- Auto-sort items using the Start button
- Fast text speed and Set battles by default ✓
- Miscellaneous bugixes (e.g., Pokemon can "miss" learning moves on stacked level up) - *note that the 1/256 glitch is being left in for flavor*
- The "Down + B" trick actually works

## Why *Blue* Remix?
While *Red Remix* does roll off the tongue, Pokemon Blue was the first Pokemon game I played and the first video game I bought for myself, so I chose that name for nostalgia's sake.

## Why Not Yellow?
Again, Blue was the game I made memories with, plus I didn't want to lock up a party slot. 

However, I do plan to make a patch for Yellow Legacy with the updated Pokemon typings and type interactions once I've tested them here.
